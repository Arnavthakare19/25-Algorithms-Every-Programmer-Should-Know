}/*This Java program implements the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm to find the majority element in an array efficiently. Here's a concise description of its key components and functionality:

findMajorityElement method:

Utilizes the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm to find the majority element in the input array nums.
Initializes a candidate variable with the first element of the array and a count variable to track its frequency.
Iterates through the array, comparing each element to the current candidate.
If the count becomes zero, the current element becomes the new candidate, and count is reset to 1.
If the current element matches the candidate, count is incremented.
If the current element is different from the candidate, count is decremented.
The final candidate will be the majority element.
main method:

Initializes an integer array nums containing a list of elements, some of which may be the majority element.
Calls the findMajorityElement method to identify and print the majority element in the array.
The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm efficiently finds the majority element in an array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it useful for identifying elements that appear more than half of the time in the array*/
