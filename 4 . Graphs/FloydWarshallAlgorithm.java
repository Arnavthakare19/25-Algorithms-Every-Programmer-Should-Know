/*This Java program implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes in a weighted directed graph. Here's a concise description of its key components and functionality:

floydWarshall method:

Computes the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes in a given graph.
Initializes a 2D array dist to store the shortest distances between nodes.
Iterates through all pairs of nodes and initializes dist with the initial edge weights from the graph.
Performs the Floyd-Warshall algorithm by considering each intermediate vertex and updating the shortest distances as needed.
Prints the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes.
main method:

Specifies the number of vertices V and initializes a 2D array graph representing the weighted directed graph.
Calls the floydWarshall method to compute and print the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, including both positive and negative edge weights. It is suitable for finding the shortest paths in dense graphs or when the graph's structure changes over time.*/
