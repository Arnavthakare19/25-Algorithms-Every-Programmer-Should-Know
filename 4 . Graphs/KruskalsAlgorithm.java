/* The provided Java code implements Kruskal's algorithm, a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. Here's a short description of the code:

1. `Edge` Class:
   - Represents an edge in the graph with attributes `src` (source vertex), `dest` (destination vertex), and `weight` (edge weight).
   - Implements the `Comparable` interface to enable sorting edges based on their weights.

2. `KruskalsAlgorithm` Class:
   - Contains the main Kruskal's algorithm implementation.

3. `kruskalsMST` Method:
   - Takes a list of edges (`edges`) and the number of vertices (`V`) as input.
   - Sorts the list of edges in ascending order based on their weights.
   - Initializes an empty list `mst` to store the MST and an array `parent` to keep track of disjoint sets (initialized with -1).
   - Iterates through the sorted edges:
     - For each edge, it finds the parents of the source and destination vertices using the `find` method.
     - If the source and destination vertices do not belong to the same set (i.e., their parents are different), the edge is added to the MST (`mst`), and the sets are merged using the `union` method.

4. `find` Method:
   - Takes an array `parent` and a vertex as input.
   - Recursively finds the representative (parent) of a set by following the parent pointers until it reaches a vertex with a parent of -1 (representative of the set).

5. `union` Method:
   - Takes an array `parent`, source vertex `src`, and destination vertex `dest`.
   - Finds the parents of both vertices using the `find` method and makes one vertex the parent of the other by updating the `parent` array.

6. `main` Method:
   - Initializes the number of vertices (`V`) and a list of edges (`edges`) representing the graph.
   - Calls the `kruskalsMST` method to find the MST.
   - Prints the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree, along with their weights.

In summary, this code demonstrates the Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph, and it prints the edges of the MST as the final output. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting edges with the smallest weights while avoiding cycles to construct a tree that spans all vertices with the minimum total weight. */
