/*This Java program implements Lee's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a binary matrix. The matrix represents a grid where 0 denotes an open cell, and 1 denotes a blocked cell. The algorithm is applied to a grid with the starting point at the top-left corner (0, 0) and the destination at the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1). The main components are as follows:

1. **`shortestPathBinaryMatrix` method:**
   - Takes a 2D array (`grid`) as input, where 0 represents an open cell, and 1 represents a blocked cell.
   - Initializes a queue for BFS traversal and a 2D array (`directions`) to define possible movement directions (including diagonal movements).
   - Marks the start cell as visited (grid[0][0] = 1) and adds it to the queue.
   - Performs BFS traversal while updating the distance (number of steps) from the start.
   - If the destination cell (bottom-right) is reached, returns the shortest path length. Otherwise, returns -1 if no path is found.

2. **`main` method:**
   - Creates a binary matrix representing a grid.
   - Calls `shortestPathBinaryMatrix` with the grid and prints the shortest path length.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The algorithm uses BFS to explore possible paths in the matrix.
   - It iteratively visits neighboring cells, marking them as visited and enqueueing them if they are valid and not blocked.
   - The process continues until the destination is reached or no more cells are reachable.
   - The final result is the shortest path length from the start to the destination or -1 if no path exists.

In the provided example, the grid has a start at the top-left (0, 0) and a destination at the bottom-right (2, 2). The blocked cells are represented by 1, and the open cells are represented by 0. The output would be the length of the shortest path, considering valid moves in all directions, or -1 if no path is possible.*/


/*The provided Java code implements Lee's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a binary matrix, where 0 represents an open cell that can be traversed, and 1 represents a blocked cell. Here's a short description:

1. The `shortestPathBinaryMatrix` method:
   - Takes a 2D binary grid as input.
   - Checks if there is a valid path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1,n-1), where n is the size of the grid.
   - If either the starting or ending cell is blocked (contains a 1), it returns -1, indicating that no path is possible.

2. The algorithm uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of the grid:
   - It starts from the top-left corner and initializes a step counter.
   - The grid is modified to mark visited cells (changing 0 to 1) to avoid revisiting them.

3. In a loop, the algorithm iteratively explores neighboring cells:
   - For each cell in the queue, it checks if it has reached the bottom-right corner (n-1,n-1). If yes, it returns the step count as the shortest path length.
   - Otherwise, it explores adjacent cells in eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) if they are within bounds and unvisited (have a 0).

4. If the queue becomes empty without finding a path to the destination, the method returns -1, indicating that no valid path exists.

5. In the `main` method:
   - An example binary grid is provided.
   - The `shortestPathBinaryMatrix` method is called to find the shortest path length.
   - The result is printed to the console.

This code efficiently finds the shortest path through a binary matrix, considering both blocked and open cells, and returns the shortest path length or -1 if no path exists.*/
